In this project, we propose a framework which can unsupervisedly classify interaction types only based on motions (X-Y coordinates) of two vehicles. We propose 3 auxiliary supervised tasks and a combined loss function which could solve the mode collapse problem during unsupervised learning. We find three explainable types of interactions by the proposed model, which brings insight for driver behavior modeling.

Laser scanning has been widely used in the industrial manufacturing, especially in reverse engineering, quality control and surface defect detection. Achieving automatic scanning can succeed in reducing production costs and increasing production efficiency. In our project, we proposed an automatic intelligent scanning system based on ROS, including robot arm, RGBD camera and line laser scanner.

### <span id = "anchor3">Intelligent operation of robot arm</span>
* Advisor: Huijun Gao , IEEE Fellow and Professor of Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology
  * Employed the linear-quadratic-Gaussian regulator (LQG) to make the UR10 robot arm move to a designated position.
  * Modified the guided policy search method (a policy search method in reinforcement learning) in executing simulated robotic manipulation tasks.
  * Used position control with guided policy search method to train the UR10 robot arm move to a designatedposition without using inverse kinematics

### <span id = "anchor4">Smart car competition</span>

During the second year at university, I attended the 13th Chinese national NXP CUP smart car competition, which is one of the most famous competitions in China.
