In this project, we propose a framework which can unsupervisedly classify interaction types only based on motions (X-Y coordinates) of two vehicles. We propose 3 auxiliary supervised tasks and a combined loss function which could solve the mode collapse problem during unsupervised learning. We find three explainable types of interactions by the proposed model, which brings insight for driver behavior modeling.

Laser scanning has been widely used in the industrial manufacturing, especially in reverse engineering, quality control and surface defect detection. Achieving automatic scanning can succeed in reducing production costs and increasing production efficiency. In our project, we proposed an automatic intelligent scanning system based on ROS, including robot arm, RGBD camera and line laser scanner.
