In this project, we propose a framework which can unsupervisedly classify interaction types only based on motions (X-Y coordinates) of two vehicles. We propose 3 auxiliary supervised tasks and a combined loss function which could solve the mode collapse problem during unsupervised learning. We find three explainable types of interactions by the proposed model, which brings insight for driver behavior modeling.

In this project,  we propose a new task: judge and locate the interactive behaviors based on a pair of vehicles' trajectories by supervised learning. Correspondingly, we propose a framework for the new task including labeling rules, data preprocessing and augmentation methods, a neural network structure, loss functions, and metrics. Please refer to the first part of my [intern report] for details.
