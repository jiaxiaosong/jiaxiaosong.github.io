In this project, we designed a motion planning method for urban autonomous vehicles. This method have the advantages of fast sampling speed, time-bounded collison-free path generation and sampling-based decision making method.

Laser scanning has been widely used in the industrial manufacturing, especially in reverse engineering, quality control and surface defect detection. Achieving automatic scanning can succeed in reducing production costs and increasing production efficiency. In our project, we proposed an automatic intelligent scanning system based on ROS, including robot arm, RGBD camera and line laser scanner.

### <span id = "anchor3">Intelligent operation of robot arm</span>
* Advisor: Huijun Gao , IEEE Fellow and Professor of Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology
  * Employed the linear-quadratic-Gaussian regulator (LQG) to make the UR10 robot arm move to a designated position.
  * Modified the guided policy search method (a policy search method in reinforcement learning) in executing simulated robotic manipulation tasks.
  * Used position control with guided policy search method to train the UR10 robot arm move to a designatedposition without using inverse kinematics

### <span id = "anchor4">Smart car competition</span>

During the second year at university, I attended the 13th Chinese national NXP CUP smart car competition, which is one of the most famous competitions in China.
